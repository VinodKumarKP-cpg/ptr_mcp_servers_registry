### Option 1: Direct UV Run (Recommended)
Use uv to run the server directly without local installation:

```json
{
  "code-remediation-server": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--with",
      "git+https://github.com/Capgemini-Innersource/ptr_mcp_servers_registry.git",
      "code-remediation-server"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Pip Install + Run
Install the package first, then run the server:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Capgemini-Innersource/ptr_mcp_servers_registry.git
```

Then configure your MCP client:
```json
{
  "code-remediation-server": {
    "command": "code-remediation-server",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Local Clone + UV Run
Clone the repository locally and run with uv:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Capgemini-Innersource/ptr_mcp_servers_registry.git
```

Then configure your MCP client:
```json
{
  "code-remediation-server": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--directory",
      "/path/to/ptr_mcp_servers_registry",
      "code-remediation-server"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 4: Local Docker Compose Setup

You can run the MCP server registry locally using Docker Compose. This is ideal for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Capgemini-Innersource/ptr_mcp_servers_registry.git
   cd ptr_mcp_servers_registry
   ```

2. **Build and start all services:**
   ```bash
   make start-all
   ```

3. **Or start a specific service:**
   ```bash
   make start-code_remediation_server
   ```

4. **List available services:**
   ```bash
   make list-services
   ```

5. **Configure your client to use the local server:**
   In your client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop), add the server with the local URL:
   ```json
   {
     "git-server": {
       "command":"npx",
    	"args":["mcp-remote@latest","http://localhost:8001/mcp", "--allow-http"]
     }
   }
   ```

#### Available Make Commands

   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Capgemini-Innersource/ptr_mcp_servers_registry.git
   cd ptr_mcp_servers_registry
   
   # Build and start services
   make start-all
   ```

2. **Configure firewall (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Allow traffic on port 8001
   # Check the servers/server_config.json for the list of ports to be opened
   sudo ufw allow 8001
   ```

3. **Configure your client to use the remote server:**
   In your client configuration, use the remote server URL:
   ```json
   {
     "git-server": {
       "command":"npx",
    	"args":["mcp-remote@latest","http://remote-ip:8001/mcp", "--allow-http"]
     }
   }
   ```
